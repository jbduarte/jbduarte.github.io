> **Fields of Interest**: Macroeconomics, Housing, Monetary Policy and Economic Growth


My research focus on two main areas: housing and structural transformation.

In structural transformation, I study how the sectoral composition of the economy explains the slowdown in aggregate labor productivity growth. Methodologically, I use a mix of theory and empirics to study the aforementioned research questions.
