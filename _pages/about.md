> **Fields of Interest**: Macroeconomics, Housing, Monetary Policy and Economic Growth


My research focus on two main areas: housing and structural transformation. In housing, I incorporate micro-founded features of the housing market into macroeconomic models to study the interplay between monetary policy and the housing market. In structural transformation, I study how the sectoral composition of the economy explains the slowdown in aggregate labor productivity growth. Methodologically, I use a mix of theory and empirics to study the aforementioned research questions.
